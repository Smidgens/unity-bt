# 🎯 Goal

* Provide lean runtime engine for Behaviour Trees that is agnostic of implementation specifics or serialization schemes.
* Provide optional low-level utilities for implementing commonly used patterns for serialization, editor GUI, or runtime debugging.

<br/>

# ℹ️ Features

* Fairly generic, reasonably performant.
* Extensible through composition with custom tasks, decorators, and services.
