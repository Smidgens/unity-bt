Behaviour Tree library for Unity.

[Wiki](https://github.com/Smidgenomics/unity.plugins/wiki/Behaviour-Trees)

<br/>

# 🎯 Goals

* Provide standard BT boilerplate logic while staying use-case agnostic.
* Avoid GUI, serialization or debugging mechanisms, but provide common utilities for such features to be implemented separately without impacting core runtime logic.

<br/>

# ℹ️ Features

* Fairly generic, reasonably performant.
* Extensible through composition with custom tasks, decorators, and services.
